# PaintingCircleIllustration

The PaintingCircleIllustration component creates a painting illustration using inline SVG. This illustration is commonly used within McGonnagal introduction cards.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import PaintingCircleIllustration from '@unitedincome/components/dist/PaintingCircleIllustration';
```

```javascript
import {PaintingCircleIllustration} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <PaintingCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
</Preview>

```javascript
<PaintingCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
```

### Draft

You can use the `draft` prop to render the illustrations draft mode variant.

<Preview>
  <PaintingCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" draft />
</Preview>

```javascript
<PaintingCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" draft />
```

  <PaintingCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" color />
</Preview>

</Preview>

```javascript
<PaintingCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" illuminate />
