# CakeCircleIllustration

The CakeCircleIllustration component creates a cake illustration using inline SVG. This illustration is commonly used within McGonnagal introduction cards.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import CakeCircleIllustration from '@unitedincome/components/dist/CakeCircleIllustration';
```

```javascript
import {CakeCircleIllustration} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <CakeCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
</Preview>

```javascript
<CakeCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
```

### Illuminate

The `illuminate` prop activates the interaction variant of the illustration. By default the interaction occurs when the illustration is clicked, this prop allows you to override that behavior so you can trigger it as a side effect of another action.

<Preview>
  <CakeCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" illuminate />
</Preview>

```javascript
<CakeCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" illuminate />
```
