## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import GivingCircleIllustration from '@unitedincome/components/dist/GivingCircleIllustration';
```

```javascript
import {GivingCircleIllustration} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <GivingCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />

```javascript
