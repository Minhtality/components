# CarCircleIllustration

The CarCircleIllustration component creates a car illustration using inline SVG. This illustration is commonly used within McGonnagal introduction cards.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import CarCircleIllustration from '@unitedincome/components/dist/CarCircleIllustration';
```

```javascript
import {CarCircleIllustration} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <CarCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
</Preview>

```javascript
<CarCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
```

### Draft

You can use the `draft` prop to render the illustrations draft mode variant.

```javascript
<CarCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" illuminate />
