# MoneyCircleIllustration

The MoneyCircleIllustration component creates a money illustration using inline SVG. This illustration is commonly used within McGonnagal introduction cards.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import MoneyCircleIllustration from '@unitedincome/components/dist/MoneyCircleIllustration';
```

```javascript
import {MoneyCircleIllustration} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <MoneyCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
</Preview>

```javascript
<MoneyCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
```

### Illuminate

The `illuminate` prop activates the interaction variant of the illustration. By default the interaction occurs when the illustration is clicked, this prop allows you to override that behavior so you can trigger it as a side effect of another action.

  <MoneyCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" illuminate />

```javascript
<MoneyCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" illuminate />
