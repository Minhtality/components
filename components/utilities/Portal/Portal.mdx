# Portal

Creates a [React Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) which pulls DOM nodes out of their container.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import Portal from '@unitedincome/components/dist/Portal';
```

```javascript
import {Portal} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

```javascript
<Portal>
  <CabinetInterior />
</Portal>
```

### Forwarding Refs

For elements which require click handlers which interact with the body, you can forward a `ref` into the child component like so. This will allow your parent component to see when the portaled child has been interacted with.

```javascript
<Portal>
  <CabinetInterior ref={this.cabinetNode}>{children}</CabinetInterior>
</Portal>;

const CabinetInterior = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <aside {...props} ref={ref} />;
});
```

### usePortal Hook

If you'd like to consume the logic that creates a `div` at the root of `body` you can use the `usePortal` hook.

```javascript
const portal = usePortal()

<Component portalElement={portla} />
```
